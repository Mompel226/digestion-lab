     These labs are public: anyone in the world can use one, and should. But only your own
     students' results should reach your spreadsheet, so work is recorded when the Google
     account that signed in is on your Students tab, and ignored otherwise.

     A Client ID is a name-tag for your app, issued by Google — not a secret, and visible
     in this file on purpose. This page uses it to ask Google for a sign-in; the Apps Script
     uses the SAME id to check the token it gets back was made for your app and not somebody
     else's. Paste it in both places (it ends .apps.googleusercontent.com). Leave it empty
     and nothing is recorded anywhere — the lab still works, from what the browser keeps.

     To make one: console.cloud.google.com ▸ pick or make a project ▸ Google Auth Platform ▸
     Branding (fill this in first — Google will not issue an id without it) ▸ Audience ▸
     Publish app ▸ Credentials ▸ Create credentials ▸ OAuth client ID ▸ Web application,
     with https://nlcsbiology.com as an authorised JavaScript origin — no path, no
     trailing slash.

     The full version is in the Biology Hub README (github.com/Mompel226/igcse-biology-hub),
     under "Step 3 · Switch on sign-in". */
